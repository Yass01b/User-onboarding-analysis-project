# User Onboarding Analysis

## Overview
This analysis is focused on understanding the user onboarding process of a SaaS platform similar to Zoom. However, it is important to note that the dataset used for this analysis is fictional and does not represent actual user data from real-world SaaS platform. The variables and their definitions are meant to serve as an example of the type of user-level data that a SaaS company might track to understand its users' onboarding lifecycle and engagement.

Since this is a hypothetical scenario, the data used in this analysis is dummy data, not real user data. The purpose is to demonstrate the types of insights that can be derived from such a comprehensive user dataset, rather than to present findings about a specific real-world SaaS platform.

The key objectives of this analysis are:

***User Onboarding and drop-off points***: Examining the user registration, email verification, profile setup, and tutorial completion processes to identify areas for optimization and improving the onboarding experience.

***User Engagement and Feature Adoption***: Tracking the user's interactions with core features, such as accessing introductions, starting and completing feature tutorials, and taking their first action on the platform. This will help understand feature usage and identify opportunities to drive deeper engagement.

***User Support and Self-Service***: Analyzing the user's interactions with the platform's support resources, including page views on the "Getting Started," "Account Management," "Audio and Video," and "Integration" sections. This can provide insights into the user's support needs and areas for improvement in the self-service experience.

***User Segmentation and Differentiation***: Exploring user characteristics, such as demographics, signup source, and subscription type, to identify distinct user segments and understand how their behaviors and engagement patterns may differ.

By analyzing this comprehensive, but fictional, dataset, the aim is to gain a deep understanding of the user lifecycle, pinpoint areas for improvement in the user experience, and develop strategies to drive user acquisition, activation, engagement, and retention for the SaaS platform.

The findings from this analysis can inform product roadmaps, marketing strategies, and customer success initiatives to enhance the overall user experience and foster long-term loyalty and growth for the SaaS platform. However, it's important to remember that these insights would need to be validated against real user data before being applied to a live product or business.

## Project Structure

_This analysis will be divided into the following sections_:

1. **Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_Visualization**:
   
## Questions:

- Drop-off stages: Analyze at which stage users are dropping off the most, e.g. profile setup, tutorial completion, firt action taken etc.. This analysis is done through calculation of completion rates of each stage.

- User stuck points: Identify steps where users are starting but not completing, e.g. email verification, completed tutorials, feature intros.

- Steps duration analysis : Examine how long users take to complete different steps.

- Support usage: Analyze which support pages are viewed most frequently. This can indicate areas users need more guidance.

- Segmentation analysis: Break down drop-off rates by user demographics, signup sources and subscription types. This can uncover targeted ways to optimize onboarding.

2. **Hypothesis_Testing**:
   
* Relationship between User Type and Tutorial Duration 
    
* Relationship between User Type and First action taken

* Relationship between User Type and Signup Source

* Difference in Tutorial Duration between User Segments
